                <p>When we look into the reasons for people going missing based on their age group, the justifications are distinct. Among children and teenagers, the reasons for going missing most commonly include them being unaccompanied (often a migrant or trafficked child), relationships or school issues.</p>
                <p>For unaccompanied children between the ages of five to eight, there is a high level of risk. About 29% of reported cases of five to eight-year-olds went missing due to their vulnerable status as an unaccompanied juvenile. However, it becomes less frequent for children and teenagers in older age groups, where drugs, alcohol and relationships are higher up the scale. It still holds a worry among children aged nine and above, either being ranked the second or third most common reasons dependent on age. Relationships are the most common reason for missing among teenagers at around 24 to 25%, whether that is a romantic relationship or a relationship with a friend or family member. School problems are also outstanding reasons among school-age children with almost one-third of missing children aged 9 to 11 giving school as their reason.</p>

                <p>Professor Karen Shalev-Greene, the director of the Centre for the Study of Missing Persons at the University of Portsmouth, explains that different backgrounds can have an influence on children going missing. </p> 
                <p>"Kids, however difficult the background that they are coming from, they are pulled towards their family and they start running away or they are placed in a care home that is not a good care home: there's no good management, nobody is actually on top of it, and to hold them accountable, and so children are being groomed and are being exploited so they run away. </p>
                <p>You get a variety. You also get children that are really suffering from mental health and run away because that's part of the symptom of their mental health deterioration. In some of those cases when they are moved into secure homes, they actually are much better." said Professor Shalev-Greene.</p>
                <p>There are some other perspectives of missing children worth noting. The biggest reason among 0 to four-year-old children for going missing is domestic abuse. This figure is complex as it numerically depicts stories ranging from abused parents fleeing with young children to abusers or their associates taking children away maliciously.</p>

                <p>Concerning young adults and working ages (aged 18 to 21, 22 to 39 and 40 to 59), the bigger reasons for going missing are mental health, followed by relationships. Mental health problems covered around 25 to 27% in these all age groups, while relationship accounts for 17 to 19%.</p>
                <p>Besides the two main reasons for missing adults mentioned above, depression, anxiety, and drugs and alcohol also stand in either third or fourth rank respectively at 11 to 17 %.</p>

                <p>The last two age groups we consider are the senior citizens from age 60 to 79 and 80 and upwards. Most of the missing people in these age groups suffer from dementia. Mental health still is the second essential reason for 60 to 79-year-old missing people, but Alzheimer's disease replaces this position in people aged 80 and upwards, where mental health falls into the third rank instead.</p>

                <p>Relationships are one of the main causes of missing incidents in every group of people except senior citizens. Dr Shalev-Green explained why relationships rank highly as the main reason for children to go missing. She said that although stability and security are the things children crave, some are not lucky enough to have stable homes. </p>
                <p>"A child craves stability and security. With those that live at home, the situation is often is a dynamic that is dysfunctional, for whatever reason that is. </p> 
                <p>It could be eviction in the home, it could be still a loving home but for example, a mother who remarries and had a new baby and the teenager from the first marriage was rejected by his father, didn't know where he fitted din this new family formation and so started to act up and go missing. And got violent with his stepfather. So you get situations like that where is not abusive but is not also not a functioning environment. </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content-normal text-on-translucent">
                <p>Then you go to the most extreme ends of children who are being abused in their homes and going missing or going homeless is a way of survival or they've been kicked out. The parents don't want them there and then they don't go back. To the other end of people with special needs, they just go missing because they are not making good choices." She added.</p>
                <p>There are many problems in the relationship among adults as well. Shalev-Greene gave us some examples: a breakdown of a marriage can make someone depressed and go missing, or financial issues which make someone hide from their spouse, or abusive relationship where someone flees, or potential enforcement.</p> 
                <p>Some relationship problems relate closely to mental health as well. Hester Parr, a professor who studies geographies of missing people from the University of Glasgow, considers that going missing is a mental health crisis as well.</p>
