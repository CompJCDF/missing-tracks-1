            <h1>Why are they missing?</h1>
            <p>Why do people go missing? What makes them walk away from their families, their homes or schools and
                refuse to make contact? The answers are varied but as we report below, they often fall into one of a
                limited number of categories.</p>

            <p>There are 30 different reasons that people go missing according to <a
                    href="http://missingpersons.police.uk/en-gb/resources/downloads/missing-persons-statistical-bulletins"
                    target="_blank">the UK's National Crime Agency</a>. However, in close to half of all cases no reason has been recorded for why the person went missing (44%). The
                three main ones involve relationships, mental health problems, and drugs or alcohol. Among children and
                teenagers, the reasons for going missing most commonly include the absence of a parent or guardian
                (often a migrant or trafficked child), relationship difficulties or problems at school. These reasons were recorded when the missing persons were found.</p>

                Most children aged five to eight who go missing are described as "unaccompanied". Although the term
                "unaccompanied juvenile" covers various circumstances, the UK's National Crime Agency <a
                    href="http://www.epgencms.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/upload/1d4e1647-3ad5-4df3-b35e-cb167537c08b/No.26_Missing_refugee_and_migrant_children_in_Europe.pdf"
                    target="_blank">explains</a> that this
                refers mainly to unaccompanied migrant children. At some point they are registered by authorities after
                they arrive in a country but then their trace is lost, and so they are classified as "missing". It's the
                reason given for almost a third of all reported missing children cases in this age group. However, for
                children aged nine and above, this category is used less frequently. Drugs, alcohol and relationships
                are more frequently to blame from nine upwards.
            </p>
            <p>One in four teenagers who goes missing does so because of a relationship problem, either a romantic
                relationship or a relationship with a friend or family member. School problems also contribute, with
                almost a third of missing children aged 9 to 11 giving school as the reason.</p>

            <p>Professor Karen Shalev Greene, the director of the <a
                    href="https://www.port.ac.uk/research/research-centres-and-groups/centre-for-the-study-of-missing-persons"
                    target="_blank">Centre for the Study of Missing Persons</a> at the
                University of Portsmouth, explains that different backgrounds can have an influence on why children go
                missing. Some run away from their families, or even from care homes because the homes are of poor
                quality or aren't suited to them. </p>
            <p>"You get a variety. You also get children that are really suffering from mental health and run away
                because that's part of the symptom of their mental health deterioration. In some of those cases when
                they are moved into secure homes, they actually are much better." says Dr Shalev Greene.</p>
            <p>Many official reports agree, concluding that the main factors behind children going missing from care
                include the quality and safety of the care. Dr Shalev Greene said that sometimes the situation in the
                care
                is not abusive but is not also not a functioning environment.</p>
            <p>She explains that relationship breakdowns contribute to missing children cases because some children end
                up without stable homes. "It could be eviction in the home. It could be still a loving home but for
                example, a mother who remarried and had a new baby and the teenager from the first marriage was rejected
                by his father, didn't know where he fitted in this new family formation and so started to act up and go
                missing".</p>
            <p>
                Smaller children also get declared missing. The biggest reason for children up to the age of four to
                vanish is domestic abuse. This category is complex however as it can include a parent fleeing with young
                children to escape an abusive partner as well as one parent kidnapping their own child from other family
                members. These small children are the ones that go missing the most -- more than any other age-group --
                because of domestic abuse.

            <p>For adults, the main reasons for going missing are mental health problems (the reason for one in every
                four missing adults), followed by relationships (almost one in every five cases). Drugs and alcohol are
                also blamed for many cases.</p>
            <p>
                Dr Shalev Greene points to examples of relationship problems among adults, like the breakdown of a
                marriage
                which can leave someone depressed, or financial problems which someone has hidden from their spouse, or
                abusive relationships where the victim flees, or a forced marriage, where someone runs away to protect
                themselves.
