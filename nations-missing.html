                <h1>A Nation's Missing</h1>
                <p>Someone is reported missing every 90 seconds in the UK, according to the British charity Missing People. This figure has been used several times to address the problem of disappearances in the country, but can this number be true?</p>

                <p>According to Karen Shalev-Greene, director of the Centre for the Study of Missing Persons from the University of Portsmouth, the real number is likely to be higher. "We think there is quite a bit of underreporting and part of the population that won't report people that go missing", explains the professor.</p>
                <p>The 90-second figure derives from the more than 380,000 calls recorded by police forces across the country during 2016 and 2017, the latest years from which figures were released. However, not all of these calls lead to a missing person case being opened and they also take into account repeated incidents. This independent charity estimates the individual cases amount to 186,000 every year.</p> 
                <p>For experts and the families of the victims, it's still important to look at the big numbers. "If you don't search, you might not necessarily find. The UK authorities say that every life matters and it's the responsibility of the state to safeguard people", Professor Shalev-Greene declares.</p>

                <p>Following the trail while it's still warm can lead to have more clues to find a missing person and can be key as well in cases involving high-risk individuals. This is the case for children and teenagers, a group that in England and Wales amounts to more than half of the reported incidents. During 2016-2017, almost 180,000 incidents were recorded involving minors, almost 63 % of the total cases. Other vulnerable groups are those suffering from dementia or mental health issues. </p>
                <p>Regarding other demographics, the Centre for the Study of Missing Persons has also found that being part of an ethnic minority can be linked with a higher likelihood of going missing than the rest of the population. The latest report from the UK Missing Persons Unit (UKMPU) shows that after White/North European, Black and Asian are the two most common ethnicities that go missing in England and Wales, with an 11 % and 4 % respectively. </p> 
                <p>Men are also more likely to go missing in this same area, with almost 54 % compared to women (45 %) and trans people, approximately 0.1 %. These numbers can be explained according to Shalev-Greene due to middle-age men having the lack of social support that women tend to have as well as being less willing to talk to their friends or being verbal about their problems.</p>
                <p>While most people will be found within the first 72 hours of going missing, other cases can take two years or more. As Professor Shalev-Greene explains, the Police in the UK is trying to think that missing cases will turn into homicide. However, there are more crimes that could happen if quick action is not taken, such as trafficking, exploitation, human slavery or adduction.</p>
                <p>During 2016-2017, the number of people that went missing for more than seven days accounted for 8,075, a figure that doesnâ€™t include an important number of British constituencies and that only looks at resolved cases. It's also hard to estimate the number of people that would walk out the door again. According to the statistics from the UKMPU, 48 % of the incidents that happened during those years were attributable to repeats, raising up to 63 % in the case of children.</p>

                <p>In addition to the human cost and family tragedy involved in these disappearances, the economical cost is another factor that is worth analysing. The Centre for the Study of Missing Persons estimates that 800 million pounds are spent annually to find missing people. Professor Shalev-Greene explains that these numbers "can vary incredibly" depending on the case, while low-risk cases can cost between 500 to 1,000 pounds, high-risk cases escalate up to 8,000 pounds.</p>
                <p>Dogs, divers and helicopters are some of the most common methods to find missing people. Putting a helicopter up in the air can cost around 1,000 pounds per hour and cases can prolong for several weeks.</p> 
                <p>The UK, a country where missing cases are "taken seriously", has suffered a continuous increase in disappearances during the last few years. Missing cases leave families waiting for years and carry with them a very high economic cost.</p>
                <p>The number of children that went missing in 2016-17 increased by 21 % in England and Wales compared to the figures in 2015-16, while in the case of adults the rise was 12 %. The numbers are also higher than those from neighbouring countries. "I think the UK is ahead. The amount of missing cases is higher here and it's not because it happens more here, but because there is a social value: we take missing seriously", Shalev-Greene concludes.</p>
