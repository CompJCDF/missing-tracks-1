This project is part of the module MCT542 Digital Investigation in the spring semester of the academic year 2019/20 at Cardiff University, Wales.

## List of articles:

1. Britain’s missing: This section looked into the basics of what story the data told as a whole. We looked into some demographical statistics of missing people in England and Wales, the meaning behind our data, the methods for finding missing people, and the cost in these findings.
2. Who is missing?: This section focused on young people - the largest vulnerable group who are likely to go missing. We explain the relationship between missing children and human trafficking. We also had a case study from an interview about a teenager who had become pregnant and was safeguarded in a new safe place.
3. Why are they missing?: This section described the reasons behind missing incidents among people in various age groups. We also had an interview which described the situations behind these reasons, especially among youngsters and senior citizens.
4. How can we find them?: we looked through some essential figures and processes about finding missing persons. The time spent on finding them, the persons who find them, the polices’ response and several interesting technologies used in finding missing people.
5. Data and methodology: We explain the data and process we used in this project: the terminology, the limitations, and the technical tools.
