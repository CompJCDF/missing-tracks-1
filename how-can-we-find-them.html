            <p>A case where a toddler has been abducted 24 hours previously in a city centre will be treated very
                differently to that of a dementia patient who has been missing in a rural location for some time. All
                cases are worth looking into. Even in situations where a person has chosen to go missing for a new life
                or because they feel they’re in danger from people around them, it can also be crucial to track those
                people to ensure they have adequate protection and that they are no longer at risk.
            </p>
            <p>Methods for tracking people are incredibly varied and differ according to country and police force. The
                charity Missing People goes to great lengths to assist the UK police in tracing lost persons. Most
                people who go missing across the UK are found safe and reasonably well but for some they are simply
                nowhere to be found and the cost of looking for them becomes sadly too great.
            </p>
            <p>New technologies can transform the job of tracking missing persons with organisations such as <a
                    href="https://www.tracelabs.org/" target="_blank">Trace Labs</a> using volunteers and open source
                intelligence. Other forms of technology such as facial recognition are criticised as an intrusion from a
                totalitarian regime-like state.

                Most missing people are found safe and sound within <a
                    href="https://www.missingpeople.org.uk/about-us/what-we-do/faqs.html" target="_blank">72 hours</a>,
                according to the organization Missing People. These first hours are fundamental to ensuring the person’s
                well-being, but also to protecting the integrity of any evidence and preventing potential crimes such as
                kidnapping or murder.
            </p>
            <p>In the case of adults, investigators try to assess if the person was behaving normally days before going
                missing. For children, they consider if the child could have been abducted or if he or she could be in
                imminent danger. While most cases will settle within those first few hours, others can take longer to
                resolve.
            </p>
            <p>There are no major differences between the duration of the disappearances in the case of children or
                adults, as the most recent <a
                    href="http://missingpersons.police.uk/en-gb/resources/downloads/missing-persons-statistical-bulletins">report
                    from UK police reflect</a>. Almost half of missing adults (45%) and missing children (47%) are found
                within the first 8 hours. Another 12% of adults and 10% of children will be found within the first week
                and only 6% of grown-ups and 3% of minors will be found in a period longer than a week.

            <p>While some missing people will decide to return home, others will be found by their carers, the police or
                family and friends. One in four children in England and Wales will decide to go back home after a few
                hours or days. For adults, this number goes down to one in five. When this is not the case, most
                children are found by the police (34%) or their families (18%). Only a small number are found by their
                friends (2.5%). The police is the one that brings more adults back home (more than 50% of those located
                ), followed by their families and friends (13%).
            </p>
            <p>
                Some missing persons can end up abroad, either voluntarily or involuntarily, and that’s when
                international organizations such as Interpol come into play. Local authorities can publish a Yellow
                Notice for a missing person. These notices are global alerts that get sent to Interpol’s member
                countries and, in some cases, made public on their website.

                The Missing Persons charity provides another service: a heartbreaking <a
                    href="https://www.missingpersons.police.uk/en-gb/case-search/" target="_blank">gallery</a> of people
                who have been found dead yet never identified. The profiles of these people are a final plea to anyone
                who knows them - or once did. Described objectively by their physical features some of the profiles
                contain photographs of items which were found with the body - shoes, belts, jewelry, trinkets or
                religious items. Behind an online warning many include photographs of the bodies themselves.

            <p>There is something deeply sad around the stories of people nobody seems to be looking for. The stories

                New Ways to Find Missing People
            </p>
            <p>One of the newest and most controversial techniques being considered for use in looking for missing
                people is facial recognition technology. This biometric software uses CCTV in public places to identify
                anyone in its range of vision. Just as the latest iPhones can be unlocked with their owner’s face,
                facial recognition used in public places can identify individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
                This technology reads key points on a human face before translating that data into a unique numerical
                code or ‘faceprint’. The software then compares that faceprint to a database which holds photos of
                people’s faces from platforms such as Facebook or from photographs taken at border controls. Once a
                match is found the software can bring up personal data on an individual such as their name and address.
            </p>
            <p>
                In England and Wales facial recognition software has been trialled on several occasions. Police
                <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/11/met-police-deploy-live-facial-recognition-technology"
                    target="_blank">facial recognition</a> vans and CCTV cameras have been set up in city centres and <a
                    href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-49369772" target="_blank">shopping
                    districts</a> and at <a
                    href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/12/anger-over-use-facial-recognition-south-wales-football-derby-cardiff-swansea"
                    target="_blank">football matches</a>. The reasons given for using the software tend to centre on
                looking for criminals, finding missing persons and dispelling violent outbreaks. However not everyone
                feels that the benefits outweigh the potential risks to privacy and the gravitation towards surveillance
                states.
            </p>
            <p>
                At a facial recognition trial in East London, the director of <a
                    href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/11/met-police-deploy-live-facial-recognition-technology"
                    target="_blank">Big Brother Watch</a>, Silkie Carlo, protested in front of the police van that was
                monitoring people’s faces. In an interview with The Guardian, Carlo explained that if facial recognition
                in public places was not challenged at an early stage we would soon see it rolled out on general CCTV
                networks. The opposition to this technology is rooted in privacy concerns and fear of an invasive
                authoritarian society imagined in dystopian satires such as 1984. These projections are not limited to
                literature however: in China facial recognition technology has been used by the government to publicly
                shame people for wearing pyjamas in public, for jaywalking and other so-called ‘uncivilized behaviours’.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes to searching for missing people facial recognition technology could prove to be
                invaluable, providing those concerned have not intentionally gone missing for their own safety. However
                there remains a risk that the positive aspects of the software may very well be a Trojan Horse housing a
                totalitarian police state.
            </p>
            <p>
                “If it’s a tool to find people, then great, but there are also the ethical issues that come with that”,
                says Professor Karen Shalev Greene, director of the Centre for the Study of Missing Persons at the
                University of Portsmouth. While most experts have their concerns about facial recognition, other
                technologies like GPS trackers and drones are widely supported.
            </p>
            <p>
                GPS trackers, for example, could be a really convenient tool for people with dementia. These people
                could wear necklaces or watches so that their families can follow their daily activities and be alerted
                if they go missing. Then fewer families would have to report cases to the police and actions could be
                taken earlier on if they go missing. However, as Shalev Greene explains, this should only be done with
                the permission of the person involved.
            </p>
            <p>
                “The issues come when they are so confused that they cannot consent, but then you can also have the
                discussion within the family between getting their consent or keeping them alive”, she explains.
                “Personally I think it’s a family decision. I would make that decision for my mother or my grandmother”.
            </p>
            <p>
                The use of drones is another technique that the Centre for the Study of Missing Persons is looking at.
                They are much cheaper than a helicopter and can reach remote areas easily. They also don’t invade
                anyone's privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Online communities and apps are also gaining popularity as a means to find missing people. There are
                around a dozen Facebook groups for finding people in the UK. <a
                    href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/333347613355260/?ref=group_browse" target="_blank">Missing
                    People UK</a>, for example, has more than 16,000 members and <a
                    href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/679622948797094/?ref=group_browse" target="_blank">Missing
                    Persons South Wales</a> almost 10,000. These online communities in social media are key to resolving
                some missing cases. Each day, people from all across Britain publish pictures and information about
                missing persons and help each other with clues and psychological support.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apps like <a href="https://global.nextdoor.com" target="_blank">Nextdoor</a>, a hyperlocal social media,
                also help keep neighbourhoods safe and connected. Users of this app submit their real names and
                addresses and get connected with other users living nearby. Posts are only shared within the same
                neighbourhood and people can ask all sorts of questions: from restaurant recommendations to missing
                people.
            </p>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RBI" target="_blank">Reddit Bureau of Investigation</a> (RBI) is
                also a popular subreddit within Reddit. With more than 260,000 users, this subreddit “uses the power of
                the Internet to solve real world problems”. Although some Redditors are doubtful about how useful it can
                actually be. “Reddit only ever makes things worse”, a user argued on the forum. “Nobody here has any
                special technology or equipment, it’s just a bunch of regular people trying to make sense of things. In
                terms of missing people and actual crimes, Reddit as a whole either does nothing or makes things worse.
                There are some very rare exceptions, obviously”, another user explained.
            </p>
            <p>
                The rules in the RBI are simple. The first is that any criminal matters need to be handled by the
                police. “RBI is made of a bunch of volunteers who live all over the place. The police are the only ones
                who can help you with criminal matters. If you have a criminal matter, please contact the police. After
                the police have fully conducted their investigation or if the investigation has gone cold, you can ask
