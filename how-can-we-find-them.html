            <p>Each missing persons case is unique. Factors such as risk, age, location, time missing, reason for going
                missing and so on will determine the urgency of the response and the method.</p>

            <p>A case where a toddler has been abducted 24 hours ago in a city centre will be treated very differently
                to a dementia patient who has been missing in a rural location for some time. All cases are valid and
                worth looking into. Even in situations where a person has gone missing out of their own choice for a new
                life or because they feel they’re in danger from people around them, it can be crucial to track those
                people also to ensure they have adequate protection and that they are not at risk any longer.
            </p>
            <p>The methods for tracking people are incredibly varied and differ according to country and police force.
                The charity Missing People goes to great lengths to assist the UK police in tracing lost persons. Most
                people who go missing across the UK of any demographic or situation are found safe and reasonably well
                but for some they are simply nowhere to be found and the cost incurred with looking for them becomes
                sadly too great.
            </p>
            <p>New technologies have the ability to transform the plight for tracking missing persons with organisations
                such as <a href="https://www.tracelabs.org/" target="_blank">Trace Labs</a> using crowd-sourced open
                intelligence to do
                so yet other forms of technology such as facial recognition face great criticism as people fear a
                totalitarian regime-like state.
            </p>
            <p>This article will look into the various methods and responses used in the hunt for missing people across
                the UK.</p>

                Most missing people are found safe and sound within 72 hours, according to the organization Missing
                People. These first hours are fundamental to ensure the person’s well-being, but also to protect the
                integrity of the evidence and avoid that other types of crimes could occur (kidnapping, murdering…).
            </p>
            <p>In the case of adults, investigators try to assess if the person was behaving normally days before going
                missing. For children, they consider if the child could have been abducted or if he or she could be in
                imminent danger. While most cases will settle within those first few hours, others can take longer to
                resolve.
            </p>
            <p>There are no major differences between the duration of the disappearances in the case of children or
                adults, as the UKMPU report (2016-17) reflects. While around 45 % of adults are found within the first 8
                hours, for children this number raises slightly to near 47 %. Another 12 % of adults and 10 % of
                children will be found within the first week and only a 6 % of grown-ups and 3 % of minors will be found
                in a period longer than a week.</p>

            <p>While some missing people will decide to return home by their own will, others will be found by their
                carers, the police or family and friends. A 27 % percentage of children in England and Wales will decide
                to go back home after a few hours or days. For adults, this number goes down to a 19 %. When this is not
                the case, most children are found by the police (34 %) or their families (18 %). Only a small number are
                found by their friends (2,5 %). The police is the one that brings more adults back home (more than a 50
                %), followed by their families (10 %), while friends account for almost 3 %.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some missing persons can also travel abroad, either voluntarily or involuntarily, and then it’s when
                international organizations, such as Interpol, come to play, where people can publish a Yellow Notice
                for a missing person. These notices are global alerts that get sent to Interpol’s member countries and
                in some cases, published on their website so that members of the public can see.

            <p>“As soon as we receive the phone call at the control room that the handler will ask a series of
                questions, I think it's about 25-30 to get the basic information to be able to risk assessment. So we
                take the basic information, they will then perform their first risk assessment which is to decide who
                they should go to and how quickly. We use what they call <a
                    href="https://www.justiceinspectorates.gov.uk/hmicfrs/glossary/thrive/" target="_blank">THRIVE</a>
                (threat, harm, risk, investigation opportunities, vulnerability of the victim and engagement level
                required.) which decides how quickly you respond to the incident. It will then go through to a
                supervisor who will agree or disagree with the risk assessment. Depending on what that risk assessment
                says decides what happens next, say somebody was going to harm themselves, seriously harm themselves, it
                will then go straight to our force incident manager who then dynamically coordinates that response. And
                this is an immediate response at this point, we will throw as many available resources at this missing
                case as possible. That includes obviously helicopters, dogs, whatever we've got at our disposal, all
                available units in the area will then be sent to that investigation. For all other ones that are lower
                risk than immediate they go through to our managed response unit, they will do all desk-based enquiries
                within the first couple of hours, everything is done fairly quickly regardless of the risk level, we
                deal with it as soon as we get the call. Within a few hours, we begin a desk chase which is hospital
                calls, phone custody, getting more information to see if this is a risk that can wait a little bit
                longer rather than an immediate risk.” Sam Roberts, North Wales Police.

                who have been found dead yet never identified. The profiles of these people are a final plea to anyone
                who knows them - or once did. Described objectively by their physical features some of the profiles
                contain photographs of items which were found with the body - shoes, belts, jewellery, small trinkets or
                religious items. Behind a ‘sensitive content’ agreement statement many include photographs of the bodies

                New Ways to Find Missing People
            </p>
            <p>One of the newest and most controversial techniques being considered for use in looking for missing
                people is facial recognition technology. This biometric software uses CCTV in public places to identify
                anyone in its range of vision. Just as the latest iPhones can be unlocked with their owner’s face,
                facial recognition used in public places can identify individuals. </p>
            <p>
                This technology reads nodal points on a human face before using mathematical techniques to translate
                that data into a unique numerical code or ‘faceprint’. The software then compares that faceprint to a
                database which holds photos of the public’s faces from open source platforms such as Facebook or from
                photographs taken at border controls. Once a match is found the software can bring up personal data on
                an individual such as their name and address.
            </p>
            <p>
                In England and Wales <a
                    href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/11/met-police-deploy-live-facial-recognition-technology"
                    target="_blank">facial recognition</a> software has been trialled on several occasions. Police
                facial recognition vans and CCTV cameras have been set up in city centres, <a
                    href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-49369772" target="_blank">shopping
                    districts</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jan/12/anger-over-use-facial-recognition-south-wales-football-derby-cardiff-swansea"
                    target="_blank">football matches</a>. The reasons given for the deployment of the software tend to
                centre on looking for criminals, finding missing persons and dispelling violent outbreaks. However not
                everyone feels that the benefits outweigh the potential risks to privacy and the gravitation towards
                surveillance states.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the Stratford facial recognition trial in East London, director of <a
                    href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/feb/11/met-police-deploy-live-facial-recognition-technology"
                    target="_blank">Big Brother Watch</a>, Silkie Carlo, protested outside the police van. In an
                interview with The Guardian, Carlo explained that if facial recognition in public places was not
                challenged at an early stage we would soon see it rolled out on general CCTV networks. The opposition to
                the technology is rooted in concerns of privacy which some fear to the kind of invasive authoritarian
                society which dystopian satires such as 1984 warn of. These projections are not solely based in
                literature either, in China facial recognition technology has been used by the government to publicly
                shame people for wearing pyjamas in public, for jaywalking and other so-called ‘uncivilized behaviours’.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes to searching for missing people facial recognition technology could prove to be invaluable
                in searches for some missing people, providing they have not intentionally gone missing for their own
                safety. However the risks are that the do-gooding aspects of the software may very well be a Trojan
                Horse housing a totalitarian police state.
            </p>
            <p>
                “If it’s a tool to find people, then great, but there are also the ethical issues that come with that”,
                says Professor Karen Shalev Greene, director of the Centre for the Study of Missing Persons from the
                University of Portsmouth. While most experts have their concerns about facial recognition, other
                technologies like GPS trackers and drones are widely supported.
            </p>
            <p>
                GPS trackers, for example, could be a really convenient tool for people with dementia. These people
                could wear necklaces or watches so that their families could track their daily activities and ensure
                their security in case they go missing. Then less families would have to report the cases to the police
                and actions could be taken earlier on in case they go missing. However, as Shalev Greene explains, this
                should only be done with the permission of the person involved.
            </p>
            <p>
                “The issues come when they are so confused that they cannot consent, but then you can also have the
                discussion within the family between getting their consent or keeping them alive. Personally I think
                it’s a family decision. I would make that decision for my mother or my grandmother”, the expert
                explains.
            </p>
            <p>
                The use of drones is another technique that the Centre for the Study of Missing Persons is looking at.
                They are way cheaper than a helicopter and can do a great job to access remote areas. They are also not
                invasive and don’t harm anyone's privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Online communities and apps are also gaining popularity to find missing people. There are around a dozen
                Facebook groups to find people in the UK. <a
                    href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/333347613355260/?ref=group_browse" target="_blank">Missing

                some missing cases. Each day, people from all across Britain publish pictures and information about
                missing persons and help each other with tracks and psychological support.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apps like <a href="https://global.nextdoor.com" target="_blank">Nextdoor</a>, a hyperlocal social media,
                also help keep neighbourhoods safe and connected. Users of this app submit their real names and
                addresses and get connected with other users living nearby. Posts are only shared within the same
                neighbourhood and people can ask all sorts of questions: from restaurant recommendations to missing
                people.

                also a popular subreddit within Reddit. With more than 260,000 users, this subreddit “uses the power of
                the Internet to solve real world problems”. When asked about their opinion, some Redditors are doubtful
                on how useful it can actually be. “Reddit only ever makes things worse”, a user explains. “RBI is just a
                forum of sub-forums. Nobody here has any special technology or equipment, it’s just a bunch of regular
                people trying to make sense of things. In terms of missing people and actual crimes, Reddit as a whole
                either does nothing or makes things worse. There are some very rare exceptions, obviously”, another user
                explains.

                The rules in the RBI are simple. The first one is that any criminal matters need to be handled by the
                police. “RBI Is made of a bunch of volunteers who live all over the place. The police are the only ones
                who can help you with criminal matters. If you have a criminal matter, please contact the police. After
                the police have fully conducted their investigation or if the investigation has gone cold, you can ask
                the people of r/RBI”.

                They also ask people to share personal information only through private messages and to avoid doxxing,
                an Internet-based practice of researching and publicly broadcasting or identifying information about an
                individual or organization.

                Even if these groups can have limited results, when the missing cases are no longer investigated by the
                police, these online platforms are the only way to keep the hopes of families and friends alive.
